## Professional Summary
I have over a decade of experience in software development with a strong focus on .NET technologies. I gained this expertise while working on projects for one of the leading suppliers of professional electronics for the Polish Armed Forces and government administration — most recently at the IT Office of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, and previously at the Ministry of Finance — as well as for private-sector clients in the IT, entertainment, education, medical, and services industries.

My core competency is the design and development of database-driven applications across all layers: database, backend, and frontend. My project portfolio includes workflow systems, registry and records management platforms, reporting and analytics tools, and solutions for system-to-system data integration. Since 2012, I have been involved in the full software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, system architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, documentation, user training, and post-implementation support.

Since 2007, I have also designed, developed, and deployed websites — both static and based on content management systems such as WordPress and Joomla.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science with distinction from Vistula University in Warsaw (specialization: Mobile Application Design and Applications) and an Engineer degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Internet Technologies. Additionally, I completed postgraduate studies in Web Database Applications at the Warsaw School of Computer Science.
