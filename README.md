## Professional Summary
I have extensive, more than a decade-long experience in software development using .NET and PHP technologies. I gained this expertise while working on projects for a company that is one of the leading suppliers of professional electronics for the Polish Armed Forces and government administration (most recently in a central government agency, previously within the Ministry of Finance), as well as for the private sector, including the IT, entertainment, education, medical, and services industries.

I specialize in designing and implementing database-driven applications — across all required layers (database, backend, and frontend) — both web-based and desktop. My projects include workflow systems, registry and records management systems, reporting and data analytics tools, and solutions for system-to-system data integration. I have been working in this field since 2012, consistently participating in all stages of the software development lifecycle: from requirements analysis, functional design, system architecture, implementation, and testing, through deployment, end-user and administrator training, documentation preparation, and post-deployment support.

Since 2007, I have also been designing, developing, and deploying websites — both static and based on popular content management systems, such as WordPress and Joomla.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science with distinction from the Vistula University in Warsaw, with a specialization in Mobile Application Design and Applications. I also hold an Engineer degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Internet Technologies. Additionally, I completed postgraduate studies in Web Database Applications at the Warsaw School of Computer Science.
